 HTTPRouteCount                                 | Number of HTTP route associations (route-endpoint pairs) in the route-emitter's routing table. Emitted periodically when emitter is in local mode.
 HTTPRouteNATSMessagesEmitted                   | Cumulative number of HTTP routing messages the route-emitter sends over NATS to the gorouter.

 LockHeld.v1-locks-route\_emitter\_lock         | Whether a route-emitter holds the route-emitter lock: `1` means the lock is held, and `0` means the lock was lost. Emitted every 30 seconds by the active route-emitter.
 LockHeldDuration.v1-locks-route\_emitter\_lock | Time in nanoseconds that the active route-emitter has held the route-emitter lock. Emitted every 30 seconds by the active route-emitter.
 memoryStats.lastGCPauseTimeNS                  | Duration in nanoseconds of the last garbage collector pause.
 memoryStats.numBytesAllocatedHeap              | Instantaneous count of bytes allocated on the main heap and still in use.
 memoryStats.numBytesAllocatedStack             | Instantaneous count of bytes used by the stack allocator.

 RouteEmitterSyncDuration                       | Time in nanoseconds that the active route-emitter took to perform its synchronization pass. Emitted every 60 seconds.
 RoutesRegistered                               | Cumulative number of route registrations emitted from the route-emitter as it reacts to changes to LRPs. Emitted every 30 seconds.
 RoutesSynced                                   | Cumulative number of route registrations emitted from the route-emitter during its periodic route-table synchronization. Emitted every 30 seconds.
 RoutesTotal                                    | Number of routes in the route-emitter's routing table. Emitted every 30 seconds.
 RoutesUnregistered                             | Cumulative number of route unregistrations emitted from the route-emitter as it reacts to changes to LRPs. Emitted every 30 seconds.
 TCPRouteCount                                  | Number of TCP route associations (route-endpoint pairs) in the route-emitter's routing table. Emitted periodically when emitter is in local mode<a id="sshproxy"></a>.
