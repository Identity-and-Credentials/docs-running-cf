This section contains information for debugging Cloud Foundry system components.


## <a id='component-logging'></a> Component logging

The Cloud Foundry components share a common interface for configuring logs. For more information, see the [Cloud Controller](http://github.com/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng#logs), or for
[Steno](http://github.com/cloudfoundry/steno), the logging library that Cloud Foundry components use.

In `cf-deployment`, the components are all configured in a similar way:

* All of the job's log files are located in the directory `/var/vcap/sys/log` of the machine on which the job is running.
* The job's main logs are written to a file named `<job-name>.log`.
* Any output written directly to the job's stdout and stderr is written to `<job-name>.stdout.log` and `<job-name>.stderr.log`, respectively.

### <a id='db-migration'></a> Database migrations

For the Cloud Controller, database migration logs are written to `db_migrate.stdout.log` and `db_migrate.stderr.log`
in the same directory.


## <a id='log-forwarding'></a> Log forwarding

Each BOSH job in `cf-deployment` includes a job named `metron_agent`. Metron itself acts as a forwarding agent for Doppler within the Loggregator metric system, but it also includes a [template](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator/blob/develop/jobs/metron_agent/templates/syslog_forwarder.conf.erb) for configuring the `rsyslogd` daemon to forward logs to a remote machine. The [`syslog_daemon_config`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator/blob/develop/jobs/metron_agent/spec) properties include:

* `syslog_daemon_config.address`: the IP address (or DNS name) of a remote system that should receive component logs from this VM
* `syslog_daemon_config.port`: the port on which the log recipient is listening
* `syslog_daemon_config.transport`: the protocol over which logs should be sent (one of `tcp` or `udp`); defaults to `tcp`

For example, to use UDP as the syslog transport, the manifest is similar to the following:
```yaml
properties:
  syslog_daemon_config:
    address: address.of.your.syslog.receiver
    port: 54321
    transport: udp
```

Cloud Foundry no longer provides a component in `cf-deployment` for aggregating syslog messages from Cloud Foundry components.
